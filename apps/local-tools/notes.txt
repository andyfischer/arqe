Goals:
 - Set up a 'tool version' repository that tracks the current desired version of
   all tools.
   - Versions can be 'latest'
 - Store this repository data somewhere
   - Ideally take advantage of the graph api
   - Backed by files
 - Data structure:
   - Each tool has:
     - binary name
     - yarn.lock file contents
     - version specifier

 - Support background updating / push

 - Easy API for updating
   - Add new tool
   - Update version of tool
