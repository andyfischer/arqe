NOTES

Value tags
 - The value syntax " == val" is weird.
 - Some relations have multiple value-like things
 - Some relation tags behave like values
 - Should be an easier way to *change* a tag's value (rather than deleting
   the old relation and setting a new one)

Lenses versus columns
 - Are there fundamentally two usages for tags?
 - Tags as relation colums.
 - And tags as 'views' - their presence means we are getting an altered view
   of some other data.
 - Should these be different?


Sometimes we just want to find the connection between two columns, and we
don't care about the other columns in the relation.

But currently, we need to mention all of the columns exactly in the query,
or else we won't find it.

Ways to fix:
 - Have a way for a multi-column relation to be marked as still holding true,
   even when columns are omitted.

     still-true-for-partial(A B C)

     Means that we will find the same relation when searching for (A B) or
     (A C) or (B C)

     And also find results when searching for (A) (B) (C)

 - Maybe each column needs a declared purpose
 - Some are entities, some are views, some are values, some are annotations
