Goals Wednesday:
 - Load every javascript from Bob
   - glob: ~/bob/app/src/renderPipeline/modifiers/*.ts
   - Glob table
 - Script enhancements
   - Support a 'script-meta main-query'
 - Parse (or execute?) typescript
 - Create a cache layer
 - Extract 'name', 'markdownDocs' and 'activeForFragments'
 - Provide those as a table
   - Add a table table
   - Dynamically create a new table
 - Iterate through those and create MDX files

From house project:

 - Easier way to split work between local & server
   - Each node can provide services
   - Coordination to know which server (and port) is providing which service
   - Migrate Provider system to custom tables
 - All CLIs run a local server and load YAML db
 - Unify startServer and startCli

 - Easy way to set config-style values

 - Optional arguments to providers

 - Easier buildout of providers

 - Easier link to fetch data (DI style)
   - Use this for BlockDb

 - Tables that just iterate 0...n
 
 - Save history across process execution

------

 - Working files db
   X Tag expressions are not "star"
   - Provider that uses underlying storage, and only implements certain operations.

 - Support query auto-expansion (table style)
 - Store listeners in the database

Features:
 - Providers that wrap on separate processes

Code quality:
 X Bidirectional conversion of patterns to JSON
 - Better in-memory indexing
 - Stop using YAML
 
Force multipliers:
 - Method to save error cases for later

Dashboard:
 - Show live tabular results
   - Improve listeners


---

Database will have a list of recognized tables
For every query we might expand to a table based on the attrs
