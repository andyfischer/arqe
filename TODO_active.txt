 X Encode keyboard input mappings in graph
 - Write key event listener in App
 - Set up the editing interaction model
   - Arrow keys to move selection
   - Selection should include component
 - Selection changes should trigger rerender
 - More work on derived relations


Declare derived data:
 - Enter an expression like:
 set keyNameToCode == (to-map
    search/(query key/* browsername/*)
    keyby/(tag-value browsername)
    valueby/(tag key)
 )

Dashboard
 - Best way to trigger state change from graph change?
 - Key event listener is getting lost after rerender?
