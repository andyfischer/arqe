From house project:

 - Easier way to split work between local & server
   - Each node can provide services
   - Coordination to know which server (and port) is providing which service
   - Migrate Provider system to custom tables
 - All CLIs run a local server and load YAML db
 - Unify startServer and startCli

 - Easy way to set config-style values

 - Optional arguments to providers

 - Easier buildout of providers

 - Easier link to fetch data (DI style)
   - Use this for BlockDb

 - Tables that just iterate 0...n
 
 - Save history across process execution

 - Better in-memory indexing
 - Stop using YAML
 
Force multipliers:
