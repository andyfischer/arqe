Autobuildbot
  X Color coding
  X Data associated with directory

Table schema

  - Fix data-backed patterns
    - Mount a raw object with a get/set/modify API
    X Refactor runSearch so that it iterates "slots"

Logging
  - Opt-in log streams
    - In-memory data structure about whether to broadcast logging or not

X Slot {
    relation: Relation
    set(rel => rel)
}

Dashboard
 - Show all relations
   - Replica graph
 - Show usage

Replica graph
 - Get everything on startup
 - Listen to all changes
 - Update replica on changes (and trigger local listeners)

SQL storage
 - Every row needs a 'owner' parameter?
 - SQLite storage interface
 - Be able to load the source.graph file into the database
 - Add tests to make sure we can extract/dump the entire graph

Fix 'notify-file-changed' to be faster
 X Support HTTP commands
 - Support 'append' / log / message bus

Improved .graph viewer
 - View file as filtered lines
   - Mount a derived view
