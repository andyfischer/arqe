# Description #

future-shell is a programming environment with these goals:

 - Highly *introspectable*, *observable* and *debuggable*.
 - Tear down boundaries between using an application versus programming it.
 - Tear down boundaries around build-time versus run-time, or client-side versus server-side.
 - Tear down boundaries between the different programming language ecosystems.
