# High Level Principles #

 - Incremental knowledge
   - Can always add/refine facts in the system
   - The system gets *better* with more facts

 - Microcosms
   - Create domain-specific micro environments.
   - Look at whatever subset of the world you want.
   - Look at the world in the way you want.
   - Ubiquitous branching.
   - Powerful *views*.

# Mid-Level Principles #

 - Relations/facts should be as order-independent as possible.

 - Commands are very order-dependent.

# Lower-level Principles #

Automated generic testing/fuzzing

 - Order scrambling test
   - Run queries in a different order and observe that the documents are the same.
 - Unexpected input test
   - Run queries with a variety of non-expected input, for error checking & robustness.
 - Lots of self-testing
   - Assemble queries in different ways and verify that the effect is the same.
